# ClientEmailProject

All projects have been zipped up because of the size. so just download them and unzip and they are ready to go. 
I have set up a testing server on Gmail that you can use to test or you can change the Appsetting.Json file in the 
EmailSend project to your own server for testing.

CustomerEmail.zip - Is a WPF project based on the requirements.

CustomerEmailAPI.zip - is the same WPF project but with a API implemented.

CusomterEmailAebApp.Zip - is the same as CustomerEmailAPI but implemented using ASP MVC.
